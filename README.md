# The Script to install minecraft on your linux machine effortlessly

I made this script so anyone can install minecraft launcher with just one command and also have a .dekstop file made side by side


## Running the Script

Just copy and paste the command below in terminal

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spider2742/Minecraft-Launcher-installer-script-for-linux-all-distros-/refs/heads/main/installer.sh)
```
